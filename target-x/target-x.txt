0. Introduction to TARGET-X Commodore 64 game and source code

John McCarthy attended college night school to learn 6502 
programming in 1982, completing Advanced Assembly Language  
Programming 965 at George Brown College, at the age of 14. 

TARGET-X was John McCarthy's second complete video game for the
Commodore 64. TARGET-X was started in early 1986, and finished 
April 6, 1987.           

John McCarthy later moved on to develop games for the PC, as well  
as 3D game library called 3DVECT39, and then worked programming  
video games for Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Atari, and Sony.  

1. Development of TARGET-X

Development of TARGET-X was motivated by the aquisiion of a drum 
sound libary, a line drawing algorithm, and desire to 
make a multi-color game.

The game was made as quickly as possible, just to prove it could be 
done by one person, and because the author really liked Missle 
Command, which TARGET-X was cloned after.

2. To compile TARGET-X:
    - Delete existing object file
    - Load assembler
    - Run assembler
    
    C64: OPEN 1,8,15,"S:O":CLOSE 1     
    C64: LOAD "ASSEMBLER*",9
    C64: RUN
            OBJECT FILE: O
            HARD COPY: N
            CROSS REFERENCE: N
            SOURCE FILE NAME: LABELS

To link TARGET-X:
    - Reset C64
    - Load STRINGMON
    - Clear memory
    - Link object file
    - Delete O object file
    - Delete TARGET-X.PRG file
    - Save file 
    
    The original object file is deleted after linking, to free up 
    disk space in order to save the TARGET-X.PRG file, on the 
    the limited C64 disk.

    C64: SYS 64738
    C64: LOAD "8000.1*",9,1
    C64: SYS 32768
         .F 0801 5FFF 00
         .* 8,"O"    
         .@ 8,"S:O"
         .@ 8,"S:TARGET-X"
         .S 8,"TARGET-X",0801,40FF
         .X
    C64: RUN
